# Twitter auto tweet bot programme

Hi. This is the twitter auto tweet bot programme using PHP, Mysql and cron.

## In advance

You can set up the following check-points in advance.

- In **index.php**, identify which Mysql server you use and set username and password.
- In **tweet.php**, set your **Customer Key**, **Customer Secret**, **Access Token**, and **Access Token Secret**.
- Set **tweet.php** into activation an hour via cron.

Then you can enjoy this programme!

## Usage

- Access **index.php** and type your tweet. Then it is registrated on the server.
- The registrated tweets are automatically tweeted one by one through the programme via cron.
- You can edit the tweets freely on the waiting list on the server.

Thank you.
